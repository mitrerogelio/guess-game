# Rust Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game created using the Rust programming language. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the player to guess the number. The player has an unlimited number of attempts to guess the correct number, and the game provides feedback to help the player make better guesses.

## How to Play

To play the game, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Once you have Rust and Cargo set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `cargo run`.
4. The game will generate a random number and prompt you to enter your first guess.
5. Enter your guess and press Enter.
6. The game will provide feedback indicating whether your guess was too high or too low.
7. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number!

## Technologies Used

This project was built using Rust, a modern systems programming language that is designed for speed, reliability, and safety. The project also uses the Rust standard library's `rand` crate to generate random numbers.

## Key Concepts Used

The Rust Guessing Game project is designed to teach some key concepts of Rust programming, including:

- Variables and constants
- User input and output
- Random number generation
- Control flow with `if` and `loop` statements
- Error handling with `Result` and `unwrap`
